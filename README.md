# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I am Fahad a self-taught developer who has a passion for 
coding. I started learning to code when I was in 7th grade.
I have made many projects in multiple domains from Web 
development to App development. When I was in grade 9th, I built a 
SaaS from scratch and was able to scale it. But I always wanted to 
work on some futuristic projects and Blockchain really caught my 
attention. And I started learning Blockchain and made amazing 
projects. Currently, I am building Web3Forge: an educational web3 platform with my team(present mostly from INDIA).
